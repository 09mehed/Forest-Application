# Forest Application

### Forest is a productivity app designed to help users stay focused and reduce phone distractions. It uses the Pomodoro technique by encouraging users to stay off their phones while they work. When you start a focus session, a virtual tree begins to grow. If you leave the app to use your phone, the tree dies.
